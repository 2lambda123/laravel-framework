## Laravel PHP Framework

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development and put it into refactoring, by encouraging you to tightly couple all of your code to a framework you will soon grow out of.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications by 5 year olds. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs). Documentation for a proper framework can be found [here](http://symfony.com/).
